# anubis-opener
a "decryption" program for the "obfuscator" anubis

# explanation

So, no bullshit, Anubis is a sneaky bastard with how it messes with your code. It doesn't just encrypt parts of the code; it also throws in junk classes and functions, and the worst part - it renames everything to random shit like "IllIIIlll." This ain't just basic obfuscation, it's on some next-level type of shit.

The deobfuscator can decrypt the encrypted parts and even remove some of the junk code. But here's the thing - it can't magically figure out the original names for all the variables, functions, and classes. Cuz Anubis totally scrambles them into something unrecognizable. It uses random combos of "I" and "l", making it almost impossible to reverse-engineer the exact original names.
